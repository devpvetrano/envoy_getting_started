# Getting Started with Envoy and Open Policy Agent

This is the 1st Envoy & Open Policy Agent (OPA) Getting Started Guide. Each guide is intended to explore a single Envoy or OPA feature and walk through a simple implementation. Each guide builds on the concepts explored in the previous guide with the end goal of building a very powerful authorization service by the end of the series. 

Here is a list of the Getting Started Guides that are currently available.
